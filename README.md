# EduHub-Teaching Management System 
The Teaching Management System (TMS) aligns with SDG 4 by promoting inclusive, high-quality education. It addresses challenges faced by educators, such as time-consuming manual tasks, data inconsistencies, and limited real-time access, which hinder effective teaching. TMS streamlines operations through four key modules:

1. User Management: Simplifies login, registration, and profile updates with enhanced accessibility and security.
2. Class Management: Centralizes class and subject details for easier handling of class-related information.
3. Timetable Management: Optimizes scheduling, preventing conflicts and overlaps.
4. Student Management: Efficiently tracks student information and grades.

This comprehensive system empowers educators to focus on creating an ideal learning environment.
